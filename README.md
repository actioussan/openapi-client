# OpenAPI Client

Generate ES6 or Typescript service integration code from an OpenAPI 2.0 spec.

Also supports optional Redux action creator generation.

Tested against JSON services.

This is a fork from the original https://github.com/mikestead/openapi-client in which the `api` namespace is exported in order to use the generated types.
Also some linting errors are fixed in the `service.ts.template`.

Check the original author code for more details.
